# Learning the `leprechaun` shiny framework

## Comparison to `golem`
- Does not make `leprechaun` a dependency of the shiny app
- Approach is to make most things optional, not included by default
- `leprechaun` is harder to type and I'm already mildly irritated by it
- This sounds more like the `usethis` approach than `golem` is, but also might put more of the maintenance burden on the app developer (vs. `golem` maintenance which is done by ThinkR)

## General impressions
- I like the default deps (shiny, bslib, htmltools, pkgload)
